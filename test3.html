            <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent,
                and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing
                 you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into 
                 paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the 
                 subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader
                  see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points. </p>
